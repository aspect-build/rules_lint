# Shows an end-to-end workflow for linting without failing the build.
# This is meant to mimic the behavior of the `bazel lint` command that you'd have
# by using the Aspect CLI [lint command](https://docs.aspect.build/cli/commands/aspect_lint).
#
# To make the build fail when a linter warning is present, run with `--fail-on-violation`.
# To auto-fix violations, run with `--fix` (or `--fix --dry-run` to just print the patches)
#
# NB: this is an example of code you could paste into your repo, meaning it's userland
# and not a supported public API of rules_lint. It may be broken and we don't make any
# promises to fix issues with using it.
# We recommend using Aspect CLI instead!
