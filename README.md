# Run linters under Bazel

> It is currently EXPERIMENTAL and pre-release. No support is promised.
> There may be breaking changes, or we may archive and abandon the repository.

This ruleset integrates linting as a first-class concept under Bazel.

Features:

- **No changes needed to rulesets**. Works with the Bazel rules you already use.
- **No changes needed to BUILD files**. You don't need to add lint wrapper macros, and lint doesn't appear in `bazel query` output.
  Instead, users can lint their existing `*_library` targets.
- Lint results can be **presented in various ways**, see "Usage" below.

This project is inspired by the design for [Tricorder].
This is how Googlers get their static analysis results in code review (Critique).
https://github.com/google/shipshape is an old, abandoned attempt to open-source Tricorder.

Note: we believe that Formatting is **NOT** Linting.
We have a separate project for formatting, see <https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-super-formatter#design>

## Usage

### 1. Warnings in the terminal with `bazel lint`

This ruleset provides an Aspect CLI plugin, so it can register the missing 'lint' command.

Users just type `bazel lint //path/to:targets`.

Reports are then written to the terminal.

### 2. Warnings in the terminal with a wrapper

You can use vanilla Bazel rather than Aspect CLI.

Placing a couple commands in a shell script, Makefile, or similar wrapper.

See the `example/lint.sh` file as an example.

### 3. Errors during `bazel build`

By adding `--aspects_parameters=fail_on_violation=true` to the command-line, we pass a parameter
to our linter aspects that cause them to honor the exit code of the lint tool.

This makes the build fail when any lint violations are present.

### 4. Failures during `bazel test`

We haven't implemented this yet, follow https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_lint/issues/11

### 5. Code review comments

You can wire the reports from bazel-out to a tool like [reviewdog].

We're working on a demo with https://aspect.build/workflows that automatically runs `bazel lint` as
part of your CI and reports the results (including suggested fixes) to your GitHub Code Review thread.

## Available linters

- Protocol Buffers
  - `buf lint`: <https://buf.build/docs/lint/overview>
- JavaScript
  - `eslint`: https://eslint.org/
- Python
  - `flake8`: <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html>
- Java
  - `pmd`: <https://docs.pmd-code.org/latest/index.html>

### Adding a linter

Please follow the steps in [lint/README.md](./lint/README.md) and then send us a PR.
Thanks!!

## Installation

rules_lint currently only works with bzlmod under Bazel 6+.
This is because we accumulate dependencies which are difficult to express
in a WORKSPACE file.
We might add support for WORKSPACE in the future.

Follow instructions from the release you wish to use:
<https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_lint/releases>

Next, you must declare your linters as Bazel aspects.

> This is needed because Bazel only allows aspect attributes of type
> `bool`, `int` or `string`.
> We want to follow the documentation from
> https://bazel.build/extending/aspects#aspect_definition_2:
> Aspects are also allowed to have private attributes of types label or label_list. Private label attributes can be used to specify dependencies on tools or libraries that are needed for actions generated by aspects.

We suggest creating a `lint.bzl` file in whatever package contains most of your
custom Bazel configuration.
This `lint.bzl` should contain linter aspect declarations.
See the `docs/` folder for "aspect factory functions" that declare your linters.

Finally, reference those linters as `//path/to:lint.bzl%mylinter`
in the lint runner.

If you use the Aspect CLI, then include a block like the following in `.aspect/cli/config.yaml`:

```
plugins:
  - name: lint-plugin
    properties:
      lint_aspects:
        - //:lint.bzl%eslint
        - //:lint.bzl%buf
```

If you don't use Aspect CLI, you can put these in some other wrapper like a shell script that runs the linter aspects over the requested targets.
See the `lint.sh` script in the `example/` folder.
